This repository contain a list of small tools that can run independently to perform small tasks.

### snpExtractorSEG
**snpExtractorSEG** is a tool that calculates Shannon Entropy (SE). Scripts named in this convention uses SNP files generated by [Geneious](https://www.geneious.com), hence the "G" in the name. The tool takes in a region file where user can specify how to split the calculation of SE into desired regions.  


```
    *****   
        snpExtractorSEG.py is a SNP extractor tool that filters desired SNPS
        from Geneious (based on ver. R9.1) SNP files (usually in csv format) 
        and calculates Shannon Entropy (SE) by codons.

        Positions without recorded SNPs will be treated as 0.

        Note on Optional Arguments:

        -   By default this tool calculates SE with any nucleotide changes.
        -   Adding optional arguments -in and/or -is will produce extra files
            that filter SE calculated for non-synonymous and/or synonymous
            mutations separately.

        Note - ignores insertion/deletions/frameshifts/truncation
               in current version.

```

* snpExtractorSEG4.1.py -> Can take in a region file where regions are continuous. For instance: Region1 spans 1-500.

* snpExtractorSEG5.py -> Can take in a region file where regions are separated. For instance: Region1 includes 1,6,25,35

An example of what a region file looks like for **snpExtractorSEG4.1.py**. Essentially *.csv* format:

```
Region1,1,573
Region2,574,1149
Region3,1150,2238

```

An example of what a region file looks like for **snpExtractorSEG5.py**. :

```
Region1,1,6,25,35
Region2,510,1149
Region3,511,2238,2290
```
